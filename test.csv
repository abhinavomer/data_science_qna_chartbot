Questions,Answers
What is Data Science?,"Data Science is a field of computer science that explicitly deals with turning data into information and extracting meaningful insights from it. The reason why Data Science is so popular is that the kind of insights it allows us to draw from the available data has led to some major innovations in several products and companies. Using these insights, we are able to determine the taste of a particular customer, the likelihood of a product succeeding in a particular market, etc."
How is Python Useful?,"Python is widely recognized as an exceptionally advantageous programming language due to its versatility and simplicity. Its extensive range of applications and associated benefits have established it as a preferred choice among developers. Notably, Python stands out in terms of readability and user-friendliness."
What is Supervised Learning?,"Supervised learning is a machine learning approach in which an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or classify new, unseen data. It involves the use of input data and corresponding output labels, allowing the algorithm to learn patterns and relationships. The goal is to generalize the learned patterns and accurately predict outputs for new input data based on the learned patterns."
What is Unsupervised Learning?,"Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach wherein an algorithm uncovers patterns and structures within unlabeled data, operating without explicit guidance or predetermined output labels. Its objective is to reveal hidden relationships, patterns, and clusters present in the data. Unlike supervised learning, the algorithm autonomously explores the data to identify inherent structures and draw inferences, proving valuable for exploratory data analysis and the discovery of novel insights."
What do you understand about Linear Regression?,"Linear regression helps in understanding the linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm, which helps in finding the linear relationship between two variables. One is the predictor or the independent variable and the other is the response or the dependent variable. In linear regression, we try to understand how the dependent variable changes with respect to  the independent variable. If there is only one independent variable, then it is called simple linear regression, and if there is more than one independent variable then it is known as multiple linear regression."
What do you understand by logistic regression?,"Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that can be used when the dependent variable is binary. Let’s take an example. Here, we are trying to determine whether it will rain or not on the basis of temperature and humidity."
 What is dimensionality reduction?,"Dimensionality reduction is the process of converting a dataset with a high number of dimensions (fields) to a dataset with a lower number of dimensions. This is done by dropping some fields or columns from the dataset. However, this is not done haphazardly. In this process, the dimensions or fields are dropped only after making sure that the remaining information will still be enough to succinctly describe similar information."
What is a confusion matrix?,The confusion matrix is a table that is used to estimate the performance of a model. It tabulates the actual values and the predicted values in a 2×2 matrix.
